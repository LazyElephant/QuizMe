# QuizMe

When complete, this will be a quiz/flash card application which uses spaced repetition.  It will select questions for each quiz from your entire collection based on how many times that question has been answered correctly in the past.  

This app will specifically not allow the separation of questions into separate sets.  As long as the question exists in storage, it will eventually show up in another quiz.  The reason for this is, I wanted a quiz application which could be used even if I only had a short amount of time.

This will be a progressive web app without any server side storage.  This means all questions will be stored on the client using IndexedDB.  

When it is finished and hosted, I will post the link here.  If using it on android, it can be installed to the home screen as well.
